Description: A collection of functions to read in and clean tables from Wikipedia. 
    It allows any Wikipedia table to be read into R so that it can then be used 
    as a typical R dataframe and manipulated as such. It also cleans up the 
    dataframes so that they are able to be used with tidyverse functions. 
    This package allows for many more datasets to be used in R so that users 
    can explore data on any subject they desire, while cleaning the 
    dataframes to avoid issues.
